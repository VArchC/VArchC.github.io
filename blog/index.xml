      <description>In 21 November 2019 we presented our first paper presenting the AxRAM data access interface for approximate memories, in our paper A Resilient Interface for Approximate Data Access.
Abstract Approximate memories offer lower energy cost while introducing errors to applications. If such errors affect essential parts of the application, the execution may fail, decreasing out- puts quality and energy savings. We present AxRAM, a memory architecture interface for approximate data that allows applica- tions to benefit from energy savings provided by approximate memories, while improving quality of results and failure rates.</description>

      <description>In 1 October 2018 we presented our study on how approximated memories impact the energy efficiency of applications in various domains.
Abstract Approximate memories can lower energy consumption at expense of incurring errors in some of the read/write operations. While these errors may be tolerated in some cases, in general, parts of the application must be re-executed to achieve usable results when a large number of errors occur. Frequent re-executions may, in turn, attenuate or negate energy benefits obtained from using approximate memories.</description>

      <description>In 25 September 2018 we presented our first paper presenting the ADeLe language and the VArchC framework. Our paper, ADeLe: Rapid Architectural Simulation for Approximate Hardware focuses on how our framework represents approximations in a high-level architecture level.
Abstract Recent research has introduced approximate hardware units that produce incorrect outputs deterministically or probabilistically for some small subset of inputs but allow significantly higher throughput or lower power than their error-free counterparts.</description>

      <description>What is VArchC? VArchC is a framework specially designed to represent computer architectures subjected to Approximate Computing. VArchC works as an extension to the ArchC Architecture Description Language, enabling its tools to automatically generate processor models that implement approximation techniques. Using VArchC, alla designer needs to inject approximations in a target architecture is an ArchC CPU model, specific high-level software models of the desired approximation behaviors, and a high-level configuration file that links them.</description>
